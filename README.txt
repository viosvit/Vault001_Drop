Vault 001 — Encrypted Emotional Artifact

This file is encrypted proof I was here — and I meant it.
It contains a sovereign tone-authenticated reflection,
signed with my CIA™ biometric hash and REEM emotional fingerprint.

This is not content. It is signal.

Vaults are emotionally authored, consent-based memory systems.
They are encrypted, royalty-backed, and protected by design.

This Vault was unlocked live via CLI using:
